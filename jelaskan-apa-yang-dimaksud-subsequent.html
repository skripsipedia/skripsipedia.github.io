                                            uestions 1 6 refer toThe deserts, which already occupy approximately a fourth of the Earth's land surfacehave in recent decades been increasing at an alarming pace. The expansion of desertlikeconditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification. It hasbeen estimated that an additional one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is threatened bythis process.Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing naturalvegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water. In somecases the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, thefiner particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to formmobile hills or ridges of sand.terjemahkan teks diatas!​</a>

                                            We believe the Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. At percent we are forced to look to other bodies in the solar system for hints as to what the early history of the Earth was like. Studies of our moon, Mercury, Mars, and the large satelites of Jupiter and Saturn have provided ample evidence that all these large celestial bodies had formed. This same bombardment must have affected Earth as well. The lunar record indicates that the rate of impacts decreased to its present low level about 4 billion years ago. On Earth, subsequent erosion and crustal motions have obliterated the craters that must have formed during this epoch.
Scientists estimate the Earth’s age by measuring the ratios of various radioactive elements in rocks. The oldest Earth’s rocks tested thus far are about 3 1/3 billion years old. But no one knows whether these are oldest rocks on Earth. Tests on rocks form the moon and on meteorites show that these are about 4.6 billion years old. Scientists believe that this is the true age of the solar system and probably the true age of the Earth.

Daucus carota is a biennial plant that grows a rosette of leaves in the spring and summer, while building up the stout taproot that stores large amounts of sugars for the plant to flower in the second year.
Seedlings shortly after germination
Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between the taproot and the stem. The latter is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination. Subsequent leaves, produced from the stem nodes, are alternating (with a single leaf attached to a node, and the leaves growing in alternate directions) and compound, and arranged in a spiral. The leaf blades are pinnate. As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves are pushed apart. The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, extends upward, and becomes a highly branched inflorescence. The stems grow to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.[14]
Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem). High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core. Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity. Taproots typically have a long conical shape, although cylindrical and round cultivars are available. The root diameter can range from 1 cm (0.4 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part. The root length ranges from 5 to 50 cm (2.0 to 19.7 in), although most are between 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in).[14]
Daucus carota umbel (inflorescence). Individual flowers are borne on undivided pedicels originating from a common node.
Top view of Daucus carota inflorescence, showing umbellets
Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and an cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and the stamens fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.[14]
Flowers consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx.
Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive. The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.[14]
The fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.[14]
The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=9). The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome</a>

                                            I, Milton Friedman was born on July 31, 1921, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the fourth and last child and fi rst son of Sarah Ethel (Landau) and Jeno Saul Friedman. My parents were born in Carpatho-Ruthenia of the Soviet Union, They emigrated to the U.S. in their teens, meeting in New York. When I was a year old, my parents moved to Rahway, N.J., a small town about 20 miles from New York City.  I was awarded a competitive scholarship to Rutgers University. I graduated from Rutgers in 1932. I financed the rest of my college expenses by the usual mixture of waiting at tables, clerking in a retail store, occasional entrepreneurial ventures, and summer earnings. Shortly, however, I became interested in economics.  In economics, I had the good fortune to be exposed to two remarkable men: Arthur F. Burns and Homer Jones. Arthur Burns shaped my understanding of economics research, introduced me to the highest scientific standards, and became a guiding influence on my subsequent career. Homer Jones introduced me to rigorous economic theory, made economics exciting and relevant, and encouraged me to go on to graduate work. On his recommendation, the Chicago Economics Department offered me a tuition scholarship. As it happened, I was also offered a scholarship by Brown University in Applied Mathematics, but, by that time, I had definitely transferred my primary allegiance to economics. In 1976 I won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for my achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy. In 1977, at age 65, I retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for 30 years.  What did Milton Friedman do in financing his college expenses?</a>

bronze swords, pottery, and carved figurines. These beehive tombs,
made with massive rocks, recall Prehistoric passage graves in New-
grange, Ireland, but have a more fully developed corbel vault, in
which the stone layers rise up and gradually close inward to a key-
stone that anchors the pointed arched roof. Over the entrance, one tri-
angular window allowed a ray of light to enter the dark tomb. 
The citadel at Tiryns, built several hundred years later, reveals
more extensive corbelling in hallways that run through the center of
the ring walls. Inside the citadel an audience hall, called a megaron,
was located in the center of the city. The megaron was fronted by a
courtyard and entered through a two-columned porch. The center of
the room had a raised roof with open windows, set above a ritual
hearth that was surrounded by four supporting columns. This
megaron plan anticipated the arrangement of many subsequent An-
cient Greek temples.</a>

                                            We believe the Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. At percent, we are forced to look to other bodies in the solar system for hints as to what the early history of the Earth was like. Studies of our moon, Mercury, Mars, and the large satellites of Jupiter and Saturn have provided ample evidence that all these large celestial bodies had formed. This same bombardment must have affected Earth as well. The lunar record indicates that the rate of impacts decreased to its present low level about 4 billion years ago. On Earth, subsequent erosion and crustal motions have obliterated the craters that must have formed during this epoch.
Scientists estimate the Earth’s age by measuring the ratios of various radioactive elements in rocks. The oldest Earth’s rocks tested thus far are about 3 1/3 billion years old. But no one knows whether these are oldest rocks on Earth. Tests on rocks from the moon and on meteorites show that these are about 4.6 billion years old. Scientists believe that this is the true age of the solar system and probably the true age of the Earth.
According to this passage, how do scientists estimate the age of the Earth?
Select one:
a. By studying sunspots
b. By examining volcanic activity
c. By measuring the ratios of radioactive elements in rocks.
d. By examining fossils</a>

action options. The investigation will result in a report that will give direction about possible criminal proceedings and staff disciplinary procedures for gross misconduct. The disciplinary procedure may be based around breach of procedure and possible dismissal at an early stage, where there is sufficient evidence regarding the conduct of the employee. meanwhile, the police cass will focus on criminal charges and a conviction, which may take time to conclude. 
recovery. throughout the investigation, the question of recovery and damage limitations will be assessed,although offers for the return of funds by the suspect will have to be discussed with the company lawyers.
securing evidence. This is crucial stage of an investigation that is about uncovering the truth and securing evidence that is sufficient, reliable and convincing enough to support subsequent charges using the rigorous standards of the criminal justice system. Tainted evidence is evidence that has lost its integrity, infringes the rights of the suspect or simply breaches the rules of evidence gathering set by criminal law, which means that it might get thrown out of court. </a>

                                            Thunder and lightning are interwined in our minds and seem inseparable. Like two side of a coin, but how do they from in the skies overhead? How does the sky go from being calm and ordinary looking to burst with light and sound? Let's took at each in turn
 Thunder is a product of lightning, so there can be no thunder without it, lightning is incredibly hot at its center so it can even melt sand into glass. When lightning foms. It heats up the air at a very rapid rate and, after the bolt is discharged, the air cools back down very quickly. This rapid heating and subsequent cooling creates the often booming sound waves that we call thunder
Next curious readers will no doubt to read the above explanation and wonder about how lightning gets crackling. Its happens to the creation of an electrical circuit. Lightning strikes are created when a path of ionized air known as a "step leader" connects to an electrical field fomed by an object on the ground scientists call a "positive streamer". When these two forces connect, a circuit formed, allowing electricity to travel between the two locations. This is how a lightning boly is formed. The connection between the leader and the streamer also result in a superheating of air in the area around the lightning strike. When the air grows hit enough, it explodes into a radial shock wave spreading out from the initial strike, giving us thunder

The first in making instant coffee is to brew the coffee just as people do at home, except in  1000-gallon containers. The heat to brew the coffee had come from burning natural gas, and the process left Maxwell House with tons of coffee grounds away. Maxweel House realized it could save most of the cost of the natural gas (and the gasoline cost) by burning the grounds to get the heat to brew subsequent batches of coffee.

In the second year, before-tax extra profit will be $1500. profits for subsequent years are expected to continue to increase on a $500-per-year gradient.

With the subsequent incorporation of lightweight wonder materials such as carbon fibre and Kevlar, two years later the newly developed Gossamer Albatross achieved what was hither to thought impossible, and crossed 22 miles of the English Channel at an average height of just five feet!
After more successes in the mid-80 s, an American craft, Daedelus, named after Icarus’s dad and piloted by a Greek cycling champ, flew more than 70 miles over the Mediterranean Sea in just under four hours, earning their creators the records for both the furthest distance flown and the longest flight duration,despite the fact that a headwind caused the plane to ditch in the sea just yards away from our intended landing point.</a>

The expansion of desertlikeconditions into areas where they did not previously exist is called desertification. It hasbeen estimated that an additional one-fourth of the Earth's land surface is threatened bythis process.Desertification is accomplished primarily through the loss of stabilizing naturalvegetation and the subsequent accelerated erosion of the soil by wind and water. In somecases the loose soil is blown completely away, leaving a stony surface. In other cases, thefiner particles may be removed, while the sand-sized particles are accumulated to formmobile hills or ridges of sand.terjemahkan teks diatas!​</h2><br />

Daucus carota is a biennial plant that grows a rosette of leaves in the spring and summer, while building up the stout taproot that stores large amounts of sugars for the plant to flower in the second year.
Seedlings shortly after germination
Soon after germination, carrot seedlings show a distinct demarcation between the taproot and the stem. The latter is thicker and lacks lateral roots. At the upper end of the stem is the seed leaf. The first true leaf appears about 10–15 days after germination. Subsequent leaves, produced from the stem nodes, are alternating (with a single leaf attached to a node, and the leaves growing in alternate directions) and compound, and arranged in a spiral. The leaf blades are pinnate. As the plant grows, the bases of the seed leaves are pushed apart. The stem, located just above the ground, is compressed and the internodes are not distinct. When the seed stalk elongates, the tip of the stem narrows and becomes pointed, extends upward, and becomes a highly branched inflorescence. The stems grow to 60–200 cm (20–80 in) tall.[14]
Most of the taproot consists of a pulpy outer cortex (phloem) and an inner core (xylem). High-quality carrots have a large proportion of cortex compared to core. Although a completely xylem-free carrot is not possible, some cultivars have small and deeply pigmented cores; the taproot can appear to lack a core when the colour of the cortex and core are similar in intensity. Taproots typically have a long conical shape, although cylindrical and round cultivars are available. The root diameter can range from 1 cm (0.4 in) to as much as 10 cm (4 in) at the widest part. The root length ranges from 5 to 50 cm (2.0 to 19.7 in), although most are between 10 and 25 cm (4 and 10 in).[14]
Daucus carota umbel (inflorescence). Individual flowers are borne on undivided pedicels originating from a common node.
Top view of Daucus carota inflorescence, showing umbellets
Flower development begins when the flat meristem changes from producing leaves to an uplifted, conical meristem capable of producing stem elongation and an cluster of flowers. The cluster is a compound umbel, and each umbel contains several smaller umbels (umbellets). The first (primary) umbel occurs at the end of the main floral stem; smaller secondary umbels grow from the main branch, and these further branch into third, fourth, and even later-flowering umbels. A large, primary umbel can contain up to 50 umbellets, each of which may have as many as 50 flowers; subsequent umbels have fewer flowers. Flowers are small and white, sometimes with a light green or yellow tint. They consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx. The stamens usually split and the stamens fall off before the stigma becomes receptive to receive pollen. The stamens of the brown, male, sterile flowers degenerate and shrivel before the flower fully opens. In the other type of male sterile flower, the stamens are replaced by petals, and these petals do not fall off. A nectar-containing disc is present on the upper surface of the carpels.[14]
Flowers consist of five petals, five stamens, and an entire calyx.
Flowers change sex in their development, so the stamens release their pollen before the stigma of the same flower is receptive. The arrangement is centripetal, meaning the oldest flowers are near the edge and the youngest flowers are in the center. Flowers usually first open at the outer edge of the primary umbel, followed about a week later on the secondary umbels, and then in subsequent weeks in higher-order umbels. The usual flowering period of individual umbels is 7 to 10 days, so a plant can be in the process of flowering for 30–50 days. The distinctive umbels and floral nectaries attract pollinating insects. After fertilization and as seeds develop, the outer umbellets of an umbel bend inward causing the umbel shape to change from slightly convex or fairly flat to concave, and when cupped it resembles a bird's nest.[14]
The fruit that develops is a schizocarp consisting of two mericarps; each mericarp is a true seed. The paired mericarps are easily separated when they are dry. Premature separation (shattering) before harvest is undesirable because it can result in seed loss. Mature seeds are flattened on the commissural side that faced the septum of the ovary. The flattened side has five longitudinal ribs. The bristly hairs that protrude from some ribs are usually removed by abrasion during milling and cleaning. Seeds also contain oil ducts and canals. Seeds vary somewhat in size, ranging from less than 500 to more than 1000 seeds per gram.[14]
The carrot is a diploid species, and has nine relatively short, uniform-length chromosomes (2n=9). The genome size is estimated to be 473 mega base pairs, which is four times larger than Arabidopsis thaliana, one-fifth the size of the maize genome, and about the same size as the rice genome</h2><br />

Wortel berkualitas tinggi memiliki proporsi besar korteks dibandingkan dengan inti . Meskipun wortel benar-benar bebas xilem tidak mungkin , beberapa kultivar memiliki core kecil dan sangat berpigmen ; akar tunggang yang dapat muncul kurang inti ketika warna korteks dan inti serupa dalam intensitas . Akar tunggang biasanya memiliki bentuk kerucut panjang , meskipun kultivar silinder dan bulat tersedia . Diameter root dapat berkisar dari 1 cm ( 0,4 in) untuk sebanyak 10 cm ( 4 in) di bagian terluas . Panjang akar berkisar 5-50 cm ( 2,0-19,7 di ) , meskipun sebagian besar adalah antara 10 dan 25 cm ( 4 dan 10 di ) . [ 14 ]

Segera setelah perkecambahan, bibit wortel menunjukkan demarkasi yang berbeda antara akar tunggang dan batang. Yang terakhir ini lebih tebal dan tidak memiliki akar lateral. Pada ujung atas batang adalah daun biji. Daun sejati pertama muncul sekitar 10-15 hari setelah berkecambah. Daun berikutnya, yang dihasilkan dari node induk, yang bergantian (dengan daun tunggal yang melekat pada node, dan daun yang tumbuh di arah alternatif) dan majemuk, dan diatur dalam spiral. Pisau daun menyirip. Sebagai tanaman tumbuh, basis dari daun biji didorong terpisah. Batang, terletak tepat di atas tanah, adalah dikompresi dan ruas tidak berbeda. Ketika tangkai biji memanjang, ujung menyempit batang dan menjadi menunjuk, memanjang ke atas, dan menjadi perbungaan bercabang. Batang tumbuh 60-200 cm (20-80 in) tinggi. [14]<br /><br /><br />

                            14. I, Milton Friedman was born on July 31, 1921, in Brooklyn, N.Y., the fourth and last child and fi rst son of Sarah Ethel (Landau) and Jeno Saul Friedman. My parents were born in Carpatho-Ruthenia of the Soviet Union, They emigrated to the U.S. in their teens, meeting in New York. When I was a year old, my parents moved to Rahway, N.J., a small town about 20 miles from New York City.  I was awarded a competitive scholarship to Rutgers University. I graduated from Rutgers in 1932. I financed the rest of my college expenses by the usual mixture of waiting at tables, clerking in a retail store, occasional entrepreneurial ventures, and summer earnings. Shortly, however, I became interested in economics.  In economics, I had the good fortune to be exposed to two remarkable men: Arthur F. Burns and Homer Jones. Arthur Burns shaped my understanding of economics research, introduced me to the highest scientific standards, and became a guiding influence on my subsequent career. Homer Jones introduced me to rigorous economic theory, made economics exciting and relevant, and encouraged me to go on to graduate work. On his recommendation, the Chicago Economics Department offered me a tuition scholarship. As it happened, I was also offered a scholarship by Brown University in Applied Mathematics, but, by that time, I had definitely transferred my primary allegiance to economics. In 1976 I won the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for my achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy. In 1977, at age 65, I retired from the University of Chicago after teaching there for 30 years.  What did Milton Friedman do in financing his college expenses?</h2><br />

bronze swords, pottery, and carved figurines. These beehive tombs,
made with massive rocks, recall Prehistoric passage graves in New-
grange, Ireland, but have a more fully developed corbel vault, in
which the stone layers rise up and gradually close inward to a key-
stone that anchors the pointed arched roof. Over the entrance, one tri-
angular window allowed a ray of light to enter the dark tomb. 
The citadel at Tiryns, built several hundred years later, reveals
more extensive corbelling in hallways that run through the center of
the ring walls. Inside the citadel an audience hall, called a megaron,
was located in the center of the city. The megaron was fronted by a
courtyard and entered through a two-columned porch. The center of
the room had a raised roof with open windows, set above a ritual
hearth that was surrounded by four supporting columns. This
megaron plan anticipated the arrangement of many subsequent An-
cient Greek temples.</h2><br />

Studies of our moon, Mercury, Mars, and the large satellites of Jupiter and Saturn have provided ample evidence that all these large celestial bodies had formed. This same bombardment must have affected Earth as well. The lunar record indicates that the rate of impacts decreased to its present low level about 4 billion years ago. On Earth, subsequent erosion and crustal motions have obliterated the craters that must have formed during this epoch.
Scientists estimate the Earth’s age by measuring the ratios of various radioactive elements in rocks. The oldest Earth’s rocks tested thus far are about 3 1/3 billion years old. But no one knows whether these are oldest rocks on Earth. Tests on rocks from the moon and on meteorites show that these are about 4.6 billion years old. Scientists believe that this is the true age of the solar system and probably the true age of the Earth.

                            25. Thunder and lightning are interwined in our minds and seem inseparable. Like two side of a coin, but how do they from in the skies overhead? How does the sky go from being calm and ordinary looking to burst with light and sound? Let's took at each in turn
 Thunder is a product of lightning, so there can be no thunder without it, lightning is incredibly hot at its center so it can even melt sand into glass. When lightning foms. It heats up the air at a very rapid rate and, after the bolt is discharged, the air cools back down very quickly. This rapid heating and subsequent cooling creates the often booming sound waves that we call thunder
Next curious readers will no doubt to read the above explanation and wonder about how lightning gets crackling. Its happens to the creation of an electrical circuit. Lightning strikes are created when a path of ionized air known as a "step leader" connects to an electrical field fomed by an object on the ground scientists call a "positive streamer". When these two forces connect, a circuit formed, allowing electricity to travel between the two locations. This is how a lightning boly is formed. The connection between the leader and the streamer also result in a superheating of air in the area around the lightning strike. When the air grows hit enough, it explodes into a radial shock wave spreading out from the initial strike, giving us thunder
1.how is lightning bolt formed
2."...it explodes into a radial shock wave.." (last sentence in the last paragraph) what does word "it" refer to</h2><br />
                        1. Lightning bolt is formed when an electrical circuit is created. An electrical circuit is created when a path of ionized air known as a "step leader" connects to an electrical field formed by an object on the ground called "positive streamer". <br /><br />2. The word "it" refers to the heated air. <br /><br /><strong>Quick tip: The key to answering these types of question is to read the passage thoroughly</strong>,  <strong>because these questions wouldn't have been asked in the first place without their answers already stated blatantly in the text.

                            26. make the summary from this article We believe the Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. At percent, we are forced to look to other bodies in the solar system for hints as to what the early history of the Earth was like. Studies of our moon, Mercury, Mars, and the large satellites of Jupiter and Saturn have provided ample evidence that all these large celestial bodies had formed. This same bombardment must have affected Earth as well. The lunar record indicates that the rate of impacts decreased to its present low level about 4 billion years ago. On Earth, subsequent erosion and crustal motions have obliterated the craters that must have formed during this epoch.Scientists estimate the Earth’s age by measuring the ratios of various radioactive elements in rocks. The oldest Earth’s rocks tested thus far are about 3 1/3 billion years old. But no one knows whether these are oldest rocks on Earth.

The first in making instant coffee is to brew the coffee just as people do at home, except in  1000-gallon containers. The heat to brew the coffee had come from burning natural gas, and the process left Maxwell House with tons of coffee grounds away. Maxweel House realized it could save most of the cost of the natural gas (and the gasoline cost) by burning the grounds to get the heat to brew subsequent batches of coffee.

                            28. A major affective factor in second or subsequent language literacy development is age. As mentioned above, most learners in literate societies begin their formal literacy education in their first language when they start school at about the age of five. However, most second language learners do not begin to learn literacy in a second language until they are older than this (Hammond &amp;Derewianka1999,p.30). some may be studying a second language at school or university while living in their own culture. Others may have migrated to a new culture where they must learn a second language in order to participate in the adopted society.The passage above is … text.a. narrativeb. expositionc. recountd. news reporte. none of the options are correct​</h2><br />

                            37. When Michael is born, four uncles decide to save money for his future in different ways: Uncle A: He deposits $50 on Michael's first birthday, and every subsequent birthday. Uncle B: He deposits $15 on Michael's first birthday, and every subsequent birthday he deposits $5 more than the previous year. Uncle C: He deposits $40 on Michael's first birthday, and every subsequent birthday he deposits 5% more than the previous year. Uncle D: At Michael's birth he deposits $300 in a savings account which offers 2.7% annual interest compounded quarterly. By the time Michael is 21 years old, which uncle has saved the most money for him?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Ketika Michael lahir, empat paman memutuskan untuk menabung untuk masa depannya dengan cara yang berbeda: Paman A: Dia menyetor $50 pada ulang tahun pertama Michael, dan setiap ulang tahun berikutnya. Paman B: Dia menyetor $15 o</p>Uncle A = $50 on Michael's first birthday, and same on each birthday<br />When Michael is 21 years of old, His Uncle A will save = $50 x 21 = $1,050<br />Uncle B = $15, and $5 more than the previous year. It means 15, 20, 25...<br />When Michael is 21 years of old, His Uncle B will save = $1,365<br />Here is the sequence = (15+20+25+30+35+...............+100+105+110+115)<br />Uncle C = $40, and 5% more than the previous year. It means $40 x 1.05 = $42 in the 2nd year.<br />When Michael is 21 years of old, His Uncle C will save = $1,428.77 (See the image below to get the proper explanation)<br />Uncle D = $300. It offers 2.7% interest compounded quarterly. When Michael is 21 years of old, His Uncle D will save = $527.88<br />Using the Future value, we can determine Uncle D's savings. Hence,<br />FV = PV × (1 + i/m)n*m<br />FV = $300 × (1 + 0,027/4)21*4<br />FV = $300 × 1.7596<br />FV = $527.88<br /><br />Jadikan jawaban tercerdas yaa<br />

                            39. We believe the Earth is about 4.6 billion years old. At percent, we are forced to look to other bodies in the solar system for hints as to what the early history of the Earth was like. Studies of our moon, Mercury, Mars, and the large satellites of Jupiter and Saturn have provided ample evidence that all these large celestial bodies had formed. This same bombardment must have affected Earth as well. The lunar record indicates that the rate of impacts decreased to its present low level about 4 billion years ago. On Earth, subsequent erosion and crustal motions have obliterated the craters that must have formed during this epoch. Scientists estimate the Earth’s age by measuring the ratios of various radioactive elements in rocks. The oldest Earth’s rocks tested thus far are about 3 1/3 billion years old. But no one knows whether these are oldest rocks on Earth. Tests on rocks from the moon and on meteorites show that these are about 4.6 billion years old. Scientists believe that this is the true age of the solar system and probably the true age of the Earth. . . . Please underline about nouns!</h2><br />
